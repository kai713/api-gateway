# Java Backend Microservices Architecture  

This project is a backend system built using a microservices architecture with Java and Spring Boot. The system is designed for scalability and modularity, featuring separate services for handling different responsibilities.  

## Services Overview  

The backend consists of the following microservices:  

1. **API Gateway**  
   - Acts as the single entry point for all client requests.  
   - Handles routing, load balancing, and authentication/authorization.  

2. **Notification Service**  
   - Manages sending notifications (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).  
   - Can be extended for various notification channels.  

3. **Product Service**  
   - Handles product-related data such as creating, updating, and retrieving product information.  
   - Integrates with the Inventory Service for stock management.  

4. **Inventory Service**  
   - Manages inventory data, including stock levels for each product.  
   - Provides APIs for reserving or updating stock.  

5. **Order Service**  
   - Processes customer orders, including order creation, payment processing, and status tracking.  
   - Coordinates with the Product and Inventory services.

## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language:** Java 17+  
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ or Kafka (for communication between services)  
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose  
- **Version Control:** Git

## Architecture  

This project follows the microservices design principles, ensuring loose coupling between services. Each service is independently deployable, and communication occurs through REST APIs or messaging queues.  

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Handled via the API Gateway.  
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka or Consul for dynamic service registration and discovery.  
- **Configuration Management:** Spring Cloud Config Server.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- JDK 17 or later  
- Docker and Docker Compose  
- Maven  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```  

2. Build the project:

## API Endpoints  

### API Gateway  
- `/api/products` - Routes to the Product Service  
- `/api/orders` - Routes to the Order Service  
- `/api/notifications` - Routes to the Notification Service  

### Product Service  
- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products  
- `POST /products` - Add a new product  

### Inventory Service  
- `GET /inventory/{productId}` - Check stock for a product  
- `PUT /inventory/{productId}` - Update stock  

### Order Service  
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order  
- `GET /orders/{orderId}` - Retrieve order details  

### Notification Service  
- `POST /notifications` - Send a notification

## Future Enhancements  

- Implement Circuit Breaker for fault tolerance (e.g., using Resilience4j).  
- Add monitoring and alerting with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.  
- Introduce caching for frequently accessed data.
